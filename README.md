# deep-learning-challenge

This repo is for the deep learning challenge, these notebooks should be ran in the Google Colab tool so you can use the Google cloud servers because they require large amounts of processing power.  When writing the code in Colab the tool has a code prediction tool that helped generate a lot of the code needed to run the models.  The optimization notebook has 3 different models that utilized different strategies to attempt to get to a 75% accuracy.  You can find the analysis report doc in the main folder to understand the analysis purpose, results, and summary.
